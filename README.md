# lz4_decompressor
Little python script to decompress files from lz4 format to it's source

#This is a little script to decompress .lz4 type of files. For instance Firefox save sessions history in such format
#So to be able to read it, you can use this script
#First to install python itself and .lz4 library.
#Save this file wherever you like
#Then run it from command line or terminal like this:
#>python3 decompressor.py <input_file.jsonlz4> <output_file.json>
#Where instead of <input_file.jsonlz4> write the pass and source filename
#And instead of <output_file.json> write the pass and output filename
